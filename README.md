# Portfolio-Website
Built portfolio webpage using HTML, and CSS

I built my portfolio webpage using plain HTML and CSS.
The web page consists of -
> My portfolio website has a welcome section
> Webpage has projects section with their ids
> projects section contains links to the projects
> navigation bar to navigate to different sections of the page
> contact profile links which opens my GitHub or Linkedin profile in a new tab
> It also has a media query
